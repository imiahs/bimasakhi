                        <p>
                            Since 2013, I have worked closely with aspiring agents,
                            guiding them through registration, IC-38 training, URN generation,
                            examination, and post-certification business development.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Over time, I realized that women often hesitate due to lack of clarity
                            about documentation, exam preparation, and onboarding structure.
                            Bima Sakhi was created to eliminate that confusion.
