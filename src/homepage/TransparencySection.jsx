                It is important to clearly understand the nature of this work before deciding to move forward.
                This is a commission-based profession, not a salaried employment.
                There is no fixed monthly salary; income depends on the work you do as an independent LIC agent.
            </p>
            <p>
                Building a career as a Bima Sakhi takes time and consistent effort.
                Like any independent profession, results depend on learning the products,
                understanding customer needs, and communicating effectively.
            </p>
            <p>
                We provide the required training and support, but the daily work and outcomes depend on you.
                This path is suitable for those looking to build a long-term, flexible career,
                rather than expecting quick or guaranteed income.
            </p>
