                            It is important to clearly understand the nature of this work before deciding to move forward.
                            This is a commission-based profession, not a salaried employment.
                            There is no fixed monthly salary; income depends on the work you do as an independent LIC agent.
                        </p>

                            Building a career as a Bima Sakhi takes time and consistent effort.
                            Like any independent profession, results depend on learning the products,
                            understanding customer needs, and communicating effectively.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We provide the required training and support, but the daily work and outcomes depend on you.
                            This path is suitable for those looking to build a long-term, flexible career,
                            rather than expecting quick or guaranteed income.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
