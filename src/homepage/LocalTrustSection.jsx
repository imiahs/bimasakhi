                Guidance on this platform is focused on women based in the Delhi NCR region.
                Being locally familiar with LIC procedures helps ensure that documentation,
                training, and formal processes are explained clearly and correctly.
            </p>
            <p>
                While many steps can be completed digitally, the availability of local guidance
                provides additional assurance. Support is not handled through a remote call center,
                but through mentors who understand local processes and can assist when in-person
                clarification is required.
            </p>
