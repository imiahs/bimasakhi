            <p>
                When you choose to become a Bima Sakhi, you receive access to a structured learning process.
                This includes preparation for the licensing examination and practical understanding of
                insurance concepts needed to work responsibly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Much of the training and guidance is designed to be flexible,
                allowing you to learn alongside your existing responsibilities.
                Ongoing support is also provided for administrative procedures,
                understanding policy options, and handling customer questions correctly.
            </p>
            <p>
                The focus is on helping you work independently with confidence.
                You have the flexibility to plan your schedule while staying connected
                to a professional support network whenever guidance is needed.
            </p>
        </div>
