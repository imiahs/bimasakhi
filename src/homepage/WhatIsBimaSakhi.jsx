                    <p>
                        Bima Sakhi refers to women who work as licensed Life Insurance Agents with LIC of India.
                        It is not a fixed-salary office job. Instead, it is an independent agency role where
                        your income depends on the work you do and the clients you manage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our role is to guide you through this process. We help you understand the eligibility
                        requirements, prepare for the LIC agent examination, and complete the necessary
                        licensing and training steps to start working professionally.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After becoming licensed, you work independently while staying connected with a network
                        of other women agents for shared learning and support.
                    </p>
